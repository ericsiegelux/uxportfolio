         <h1>The Problem</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>
            Apple Music is a streaming service allowing for users to listen to 70 million songs, curated playlists, and original content. Its main features include the ability to download tracks and play them offline and offering personalized music recommendations. <br><br>

            What is sorely lacking in Apple Music is social features between Apple Music users, which leads us to ask:<br><br>

            <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 26px;color: #ff2d55">What can be done to seamlessly integrate new social features into Apple Music?</span> <br><br>

            The key word in this statement is <span style="font-style: italic">seamlessly</span>. Apple Music, as an extension of Apple, has some of the best designers in the world working for them, so there is no sense in creating a new style guide to solve this problem. <br><br>

            What I will attempt to do is utilize existing features of Apple Music and common social interaction features in Apple products to enhance a facet of an already great product.

      <div class="content">
         <h1>Why People Want To Share and Connect With Music</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>Music has an important role in our personal lives and our culture. We resonant with some music deeply and consider it a part of our identity. Now, research has been conducted to understand why we feel compelled to share this part of identity with others. <br><br>

            Research has shown people affiliate musical taste with holding certain values and that this assumed connection between music and values influences how much we think we’ll like someone based on their musical tastes (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211407521" target="_blank">source</a>). <br><br>

            There are also studies correlating higher social cohesion within families and among peer groups when young people listen to music together. This effect points to music’s potential power to act as “social glue” between not just peers but families (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021113/" target="_blank">source</a>). <br><br>

            So while music may be a personal experience for some people, it begs the question as to why Apple Music and other streaming services haven't utilized their millions of user's profiles, massive music catalog, and nifty recommendation algorithms to promote social cohesion on their platform.

         <h1>What Apple Music Has So Far</h1>

         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>After a bit of a struggle to find my public Apple Music profile, these were the five social components on my profile and a friend's profile: </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/profile.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p> 
             Consider me disappointed! While the current profile is a start, it becomes tedious to go through a friend's playlist and find songs you like. Apple Music keeps your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/musickit/" target="_blank">listening history</a>, along with the attributes of songs to optimize recommendations for you. Apple Music can put this data to better use for you and your followers.</p>

         <h1>3 Ideas for New, Realistic Social Functionalities to a User's Profile Utilizing Data</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            

            <h3>1. Summary of Listening Habits</h3>
            <p>I came across the page below in my research for how Apple Music uses the user's listening data and it gave me the confidence to utilize this setup in a user's profile. It is Apple Music's Replay page, a summary of a user's listening habits for the year.<br><br>
            I highlighted the parts of the Replay page that I thought could possibly be integrated into a user's Apple Music Profile. </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/replay.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p>My goal was to "humanize" the data so that numbers and metrics do not scare users off.</p>

            <h3>2. Compatibility Scores</h3>
            <p>This one is tricky because I am going off of documentation from <a href="https://medium.com/@boplantinga/what-do-spotifys-audio-features-tell-us-about-this-year-s-eurovision-song-contest-66ad188e112a#:~:text=Spotify%20Audio%20Analysis&text=Danceability%3A%20Danceability%20describes%20how%20suitable,and%201.0%20is%20most%20danceable." target="_blank"> Spotify</a>. Spotify has audio analysis for every track on the streaming service. <br><br>
            Here are some of the track metrics that Spotify offers: </p>
            <div id="big_pic">
               <a>
                  <img src="apple_music/metrics.png">
               </a>
            </div>
            <p>From research about Apple and its developer tools, I came across an <a href="https://medium.com/@boplantinga/what-do-spotifys-audio-features-tell-us-about-this-year-s-eurovision-song-contest-66ad188e112a#:~:text=Spotify%20Audio%20Analysis&text=Danceability%3A%20Danceability%20describes%20how%20suitable,and%201.0%20is%20most%20danceable." target="_blank">Apple audio analysis tool</a> that leads me to believe Apple Music either has or is capable of providing the audio analysis features for tracks like Spotify does.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>3. Algorithm Generated Collaborative Playlist</h3>
            <p>The last social functionality that I want to add is a solution to the problem of exploring your friend's music. The idea will be to allow a user to generate a playlist with a specific friend in mind. Apple Music will look at both profiles (the genres they listen too, new artists they may like, etc.) In addition to helping users navigate a person's playlist and musical taste, this functionality will also act as the social cohesion that I found in initial research about why we share music. <br><br>

            I was able to find third party websites that uses streaming services' APIs to create shared playlists. Here is a screenshot from a site called <a href="https://sametunes.com/index.php" target="_blank">Same Tunes</a> :
            </p>

      <div class="content">
         <h1>User Flow</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
         <p>Below is the User Flow I made for the features integrated into the existing Apple Music App. I added a new feature called highlighted playlist. This allows the user to select one of their playlists to highlight at the top of their profile so that the user can reflect their personal music taste immediately. </p>

         <div class = "content_statement">
            <h3>Key Feedback From Testing</h3>
            <p>Here are some recurring notes and criticisms I was given from my 8 validation tests:</p>
            <div id="content_pic">
                  <a>
                     <img src="apple_music/quotes.png">
                  </a>
               </div>

          <h3>Last Minute Changes Before Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
            <p>My biggest takeaways from these notes that I would look to implement/ not implement in my final, high fidelity prototype were:</p>

               <ol>
                  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Not worrying about getting to the profile more easily.</span> It doesn't make sense to hold on to the bottom right of the screen to get the pop up of the profile selector. I was copying a feature from Instagram without much forethought. Getting it to make sense would require a redesign of the app's architecture and that is not in the scope of my project.</li>
                  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The 20 scores for each fusion score and 100 scores for compatibility. </span> While I envision a quantitative way to match users' musical tastes, the user, as seen in my notes, may deem this as arbitrary and confusing. I lost sight of my initial goal of humanizing the listening data for users with these arbitrary numbers. Apple Music on its own already conveys sleek design and I don't want to add a layer of unnecessary complexity to it with my new feature. A fix for this will be to add a radial fill that acts like a pie chart to show how much two users align in their respective fusion scores.
                     <div class = "content_statement">
                        <div id="content_pic">
                           <a>
                              <img src="apple_music/fusionchanges.png">
                           </a>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </li>

                  <li>As for the two reoccurring suggestions, I have two explanations on why I will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be implementing them in my high fidelity prototype:
                        <ol>
                           <li>The reason I won't add messaging or reacting to my app comes down to past history with messaging features in music applications, specifically Spotify. In 2017, Spotify <a href="https://musically.com/2017/02/28/spotify-is-removing-its-inbox-and-messaging-feature/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20currently%20in%20the,feature%20has%20very%20low%20engagement.">discontinued support</a> for its messaging feature because of its lack of use and therefore unjustified cost for supporting the servers for the feature. I want my design to be rooted in reality.</li>
                           <li>The reason I won't add less control for creating a fusion playlist is twofold. Firstly, I wanted to add another layer for the user to add parameters so it is not so easy to accidentally create a fusion playlist, which might be computationally expensive. Secondly, I wanted to incorporate some user engagement in creating an algorithm-generated playlist.</li>
                        </ol>
                  </li>
               </ol>

         <h1>What I Learned and Moving Forward</h1>
         <div class = "content_statement">
            <p>My goal of this redesign was to implement my own ideas for better social engagement on Apple Music while also putting myself in the shoes of an Apple UI/UX designer by sticking to Apple's standard of excellence in their design. I was happy to receive feedback and recommended changes to make my redesign more polished and fitting for interested users. I look for resistance to my conventions for ideas and I am proud to have demonstrated some changes from my lo-fi wireframe to my hi-fi prototype. <br><br>
               Moving forward, I would like to get this idea to someone at Apple Music, as I had most of the people I asked whether I would do so and how excited they would be to see something like this in the app. Apple has already made such significant contributions to the world within multiple disciplines, so possibly furthering that innovation with this redesign idea would help people enjoy music and their experience with Apple Music even more.
